It's a shame that this section has to go to waste.

You don't use it because your code is barely monadic. Once you make your code
more monadic, the return value will make more sense. I've made some comments in
your interp.

Well, a state monad isn't provably a monad anyways. You're not expected to
prove monad properties in this course so don't think too much of it, but this
gives an intuition as of why:

I don't support ``wikipedia arguments''. You should be mature enough to prove
the property yourself.

I am not entirely convinced that your program works for various maze shapes.
For instance, does it work for a single cell maze? a 2x2? etc.
