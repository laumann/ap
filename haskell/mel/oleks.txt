I comment directly in your code. All my comments have the following syntax:

{- OLEKS <i>: <t> -}

where <t> is free text and <i> is an integer which indicates the severity of
the comment, i.e.:

0: stylistict comment.
-1: pretty bad style.
-2: problem, most likely with following the assignment text.
-3: fatal, this is why your program doesn't work.

For resubmission correct (at least) all points below -1. In particular, I will
ask you to resubmit if I have any points below -1.

Make sure that none of the things I comment occur elsewhere in your code, as
fixing a reentrant problem in one place does not fix the problem!

It is possible to get positive points which may outweigh the negative ones, but
in the end it's my own subjective opinion.
